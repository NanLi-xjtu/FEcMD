# FEcMD
A Multi-physics and multi-scale computational program for electron emission characteristics dynamically coupled with atomic structure in metal nano-emitters.
Field emission coupled with molecular dynamics simulation (FEcMD) software package is a computational tool for studying the electron emission characteristics and the atomic structure evolution of micro- and nano-protrusions made of pure metals or multi-component alloys by means of multi-physics and multi-scale methodology.
